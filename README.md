# MonopolyRandomizer

We all love a good game of monopoly, but the same game gets boring every time. 
We begin to notice patterns where the orange and red monopolies are kings. 
this randomizer creates a random monopoly board with certain complexities that dont allow for similar color or arbitraty(railroad) 
type pieces to be next to each other. 
WE used this with a custom monopoly board that we prepare before each game, making it a different type of game every time.
